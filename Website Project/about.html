        <p id="desc">June 6th 1946, in New York, the NBL (National Basketball League) and the BAA, (Basketball
            Association of
            America) combined to make the NBA (National Basketball Association). When the NBA first started, there were
            only 17 teams. Presently, there are now 30 teams, with 15 teams per conference. The 2 conferences are the
            Western Conference and the Eastern Conference.</p>

        <h2>Origin of Basketball</h2>
        <p id="orgn">In 1891, a Canadian man named James Naismith was teaching his students. He found that the students
            he was
            teaching had too much energy, and that he needed to find a way to burn off their excess energy. James then
            brought two peach baskets and a soccer ball for his equipment and nailed both baskets on opposite sides, 10
            feet high. James Naismith decided to call the game he made "Basketball". Later on as the sport developed,
            different rules were added to the game like dribbling. Different modifications were also made, such as
            adding backboards, replacing the baskets with nets, and introducing a new type of ball to be used for
            basketball.</p>
